Hey Everybody,

This Repository holds scripts to automatically email you when a specific price of an item drops below a certain threshold.

I used this to look up a watch and get an email when it drops to my buying price.

There are some variables that need to be changed depending on the person and the product being watched.

Feel free to add/edit all parts of the script and use it as you own. Enjoy!
